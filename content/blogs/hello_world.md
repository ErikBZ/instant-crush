My interest in programming began around my 10th and 11th grade of high school. Although I had been interested in computers before that,
I didn't know what computer science or programming were. Of course I know now, and, as a small exercise in writing, I wanted to map out how exactly
I chose to write code for a living.
Well not as a living just yet since, currently I'm in my last semester of college, and looking for job, but it would be nice to
forget about the qualms of a finding a way to sustain my life, and just write about what choices, and events led to this
point in my life.

### Youtube, Mario and Boredom
Like most high-school kids who were into video games, I also watched youtubers who recorded themselves playing videos games
uploading it to Youtube. This is was around the time where this type of entertain was beginning to explode, with people like
ChuggaaConroy, SlyFoxHound, UberHaxorNova and different networks like NinBuzz, and Machinima.
  
One of my personal favorite youtubers went by the handle "SSoHPKC", an incredibly sarcastic dude who worked at
Target at the time. His older videos where he ranted about his day at Target still resonates with me after working at Best Buy
for some time. His videos ranged from all sorts of games, but one particular style game he came back to was always
Super Mario World for the SNES. Instead of playing the actual game though, he played hacked versions of the game
with custom overworlds, levels and even sometimes custom music and sprites too.

At some point 11th grade I was bored and curious enough to try and figure out how these custom levels were made and
I came across a couple of tools where you could edit the game's rom. While I created a couple of my own customs levels I never uploaded any of them,
mostly because they were all pretty terrible.
One day trying to find ways to create custom maps for Pokemon, I came across a certain comment in a thread stuck out
at me in the forum I was visiting.

> *Why don't you guys learn a programming language and just make your own game engine?*  
> *- Some Dude on the Internet*

Even though the advice was somewhat handwavy, "Just make your own game engine". That sounds simple. This was
the first time I'd ever been introduced to the concept of a programming language. Before this I didn't really know or
even consider how a computer knew what to do, and how people made it happen. Since I had a bunch of homework to not do
I stayed up that night researching the topic till I found some decent tutorials.

### Ubuntu, Python and Beyond
After reading through some Invent with Python", the one with the squirrel on the cover, I began to get a decent grasp of Python.
To get even better I read "Learn Python the Hard Way" which led me to learn some Linux stuff.
I decided to install Linux on my crappy laptop that I had for 4 years, so I could follow the book a bit more. I chose Ubuntu since that's what everyone
on the internet told me to use. After getting Ubuntu running on my laptop, I started messing around and learning
the ins and outs of Linux as well as Python and some extra stuff like networking and troubleshooting.  
  
Eventually I made a small paint program that saved an image as a .bmp.
For a while programming was still a small hobby of mine all throughout high school and my interest in pursuing it only manifested after
sharing classes with two other guys, who at that point had been programming and taking computer science classes for
all of high school. The projects they created and worked on like a checkers AI, and a website for trivia, is what really pushed me to decide that I wanted to
be a programmer as a career.  
  
I write this finishing up an internship at Gallup as a Systems Application Developer, but everyone
is called that there, and on my way to my last semester at George Mason University. Hopefully writing about some
of the things I've learned, and am still learning, will help me cement my knowledge and get me a good a job. Also writing is fun.
