Everybody has a story about how they started doing what they were doing. *sounds awkward* Some people found their passion when they
were children and had parents who either supported them or didn't. Other found their passions later in life
and some haven't even found their own yet.  
  
*maybe start here* I started becoming interested in programming around my 10th and 11th grade
of high school, although I had been interested in computers before that. One thing I'd always wondered was, how
something came to be. This is a major reason for me writing this short blog. To try and figure out how I originally chose
to learn how to program.  

*move this maybe*

Currently I'm in my last semester of college, and looking for job, but it would be nice to
forget about the qualms of a finding a way to sustain my life, and just write about what choices, and events led to this
point in my life.

### Youtube, Mario and Boredom
Like most high-school kids who were into videos games, I also watched youtubers who recorded themselves playing videos games
uploading it to Youtube. This is was around the time where this type of entertain was beginning to explode, with people like
ChuggaConroy, SlyFoxHound, UberHaxorNova and different networks like NinBuzz, and Machinima.  
  
One of my personal favorite youtubers went by the handle "SSoHPKC", a sarcastic, and dry dude who worked for
Target. His older vidoes where he ranted about his day at Target still resonate with me after working at Best Buy
for some time. His videos ranged from all sorts of games, but one particular game he came back to was always
Super Mario World for the SNES. Instead of playing the base game though, he played hacked versions of the game
with custom overworlds, levels and even sometimes custom music and sprites too.

At some point 11th grade I was bored and curious enough to try and figure out how these custom levels were made and
I came across a couple of tools. While I created a couple of my own customs levels I never uploaded any of them. One
day trying to find ways to create custom maps for the Gameboy Advanced versions of Pokemon, a certain comment stuck out
at me in the forum i was visiting.

> *Why don't you guys learn a programming language and just make your own game engine?*

Even though the advice is somewhat handwavy, "Just make your own game engine" alright, that's simple, this was
the first time I'd ever been introduced to the concept of a programming language. Before this I didn't really know or
even consider how a computer knew what to do, and how people made it happen. Since I had a bunch of homework to not do
I researched the topic till I found some decent tutorials.

### Ubuntu, Python and Beyond
After reading through some of "Learn Python the Hard Way" and the other book that I forgot the name of,
I decided to install Linux on my crappy laptop that I had for 4 years. I chose Ubuntu since that's what everyone
on the internet told me to use. After getting Ubuntu running on my laptop, I started messing around and learning
the ins and outs of Linux as well as Python.  
  
Eventually I made a small paint program that saved an image as a .bmp.
This was still a small hobby of mine all throughout high school and my intrest in pursuing it only manifested after
sharing classes with two other guys who at this point had been programming and taking computer science classes for
all of high school. The projects they created and worked on, is what really pushed me to decide that I wanted to
be a programmer as a career.  
  
I write this finishing up an internship at Gallup as a Systems Application Developer, but everyone
is callsed that around here, and on my way to my last semester at George Mason Univeristy. Hopefully writing about some
of the things I've learned, and am still learning, will help me cement my knowledge and get me a good a job.
